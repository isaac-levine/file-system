Part 2 -- focusing on files under the size of 4KB and not using indirect blocks...

- 2 bitmaps on block 0 
    - 1 for blocks
    - 1 for inodes (block 0 + side of block bitmap)


- 256 inodes (bitmap in block 0 says which are free/occupied)

- 256 data blocks (bitmap in block 0 says which are free/occupied)






- Blocks bitmap is started at block 0 every time...
